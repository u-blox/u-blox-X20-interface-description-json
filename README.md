# u-blox-X20-interface-description-json
This repository provides a structured JSON-based description of the protocol interface for the u-blox X20 product firmwares.
These JSON files serve as machine‑readable, structured interface specifications for u‑blox firmware. They complement traditional PDF documentation by providing a format that is easy for tools, automation pipelines, and applications to parse reliably and consistently.
What they contain:
* Configuration groups – hierarchical definitions of all configurable areas
* Configuration keys – including types, ranges, defaults, constraints
* Supported messages for all supported protocols – UBX, NMEA, RTCM, etc.
* Allowed values, enumerations, and valid parameter ranges
* Firmware and product metadata
